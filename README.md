I am Yutong. I am currently learning coding in ***Hive 🐝 Helsinki***. \
You can learn more about Hive via this link [Hive Heslink](https://www.hive.fi/en/)\
\
Before joining Hive Helsinki, I worked as a software product manager for 6 years, specializing in SaaS products and B2B products.  Feel free to connect with me through my LinkedIn  [my profile](www.linkedin.com/in/yutongdeng). Now I am currently facilitating the growth of a tech start up company in Finland. Find out more about the company [Hearten](https://heartenapp.ai/) \
\
Deepening my understanding of coding has been a really fun journey and I will try to update my studying journey as it goes. I will post projects that I feel proud of or that I had unique understanding about. \
Hope you will find my GitHub fun to look at 🙋‍♀️.
