Hi I am Yutong. I am currently learning coding in Hive 🐝 Helsinki. 
Before joing Hive Helsinki, I have been working as a software product manager for 6 years, specialized in SaaS products and B2B products. 
Deepening my understanding in coding has been a really fun journey and I will try to update my studying journey as it goes. 
Hope you will find my github fun to look at 🙋‍♀️ if you have any questions or inquries, feel free to reach out to me via my Linkedin DM.
